## 🌱 About Me
I am a first-year Computer Science student exploring the foundations of programming, cloud technologies, and AI.  
My long-term goal is to work in **Japan** in a Cloud + AI engineering role, combining technical skills with Japanese language ability.

I enjoy learning quietly, building small but meaningful projects, and polishing them until they feel complete.

## 🧪 Skills I’m Actively Learning
- **Python** — fundamentals + practical scripting  
- **Web Development** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Cloud Computing** — AWS fundamentals  
- **Japanese Language** — JLPT N5 → aiming for N3  
- **AI Development** — starting with simple assistants and expanding later
